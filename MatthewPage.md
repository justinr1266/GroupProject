# Matthew Han

I'm from Aurora, CO and have lived in Colorado my entire life. I'm currently a freshman here at CU Boulder studying computer science with an interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I'm looking to expand not only my technical skills, but also my network here at CU. I currently have experience coding in Python, C++, and HTML.
