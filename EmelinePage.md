Emeline Mitchell, University of Colorado Boulder

I am currently a Freshman studying Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am working to
learn and understand multiple coding languages, and apply my prior work experience to a internship or job
involving computer science while moving towards the completion of my degree.

I have been working in the restaurant industry for the last four years, and have learned great customer service
skills and how to be a hard working member of a team. I hope to be able to apply my college education to
another job field in software engineering or generative AI in the upcoming years.
